# Full Stack Professional

I've embarked on this super cool journey into the world of full stack development. Over this course, I'm immersing myself in a massive 55+ hour course from [Amigoscode](https://amigoscode.com/p/full-stack-professional) that's going to take me from the basics to pro-level. I just wanted to share the highlights of what I'll be diving into, and I'm super excited!

**What I'm Learning:**

- **Spring Boot 3:** This is all about crafting the back-end of web applications. It’s like the engine room of a big ship!
- **HTTP & API Magic:** This is where the front and back of a website chat with each other. I’m learning the language of their conversation.
- **Dev Tools & Tricks:** Discovering all the cool gadgets that developers use to make their work easier.
- **Error Handling:** Because things don’t always go to plan, but when they don’t, I’ll know how to handle it gracefully.
- **Databases with PostgreSQL:** Think of this as the vault where all the website’s precious information is stored.
- **Spring Data JPA & Flyway:** These are the tools to smoothly move things in and out of that vault.
- **JDBC:** This one’s like a super-efficient courier, getting data to where it needs to go.
- **Testing:** Making sure everything I build is rock solid.
- **Docker:** Packing up web apps so they’re ready to travel the world (of the internet).
- **AWS:** It's like our apps' home in the cloud. Pretty high-tech stuff!
- **Frontend Fun with JavaScript, React & Angular:** This is where we make things look pretty and interactive for the user.
- **Spring Security 6:** Keeping things locked up tight so only the right people get in.
- **User Sign-up and Login Systems:** The digital equivalent of a bouncer checking IDs.
- **TypeScript & Angular:** Giving me the tools to write code that’s both powerful and neat.
- **DevOps Vibes:** All about teamwork, collaboration, and keeping the digital gears running smoothly.

As I go along, I’m documenting all the cool stuff I create, the challenges I face, and the solutions I find. If you're curious or ever want to team up on a fun project, give me a shout!
